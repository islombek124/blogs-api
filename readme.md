# NodeJS Blogs API

The NodeJS Blogs API is a backend application that provides RESTful API endpoints for managing blog posts. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts and associated metadata. This API is designed to be used as a backend service for a blogging platform or any other application that requires blog post management.

## Features

- Create a new blog post with title, content, author, and any additional metadata.
- Retrieve a list of all blog posts or fetch a specific blog post by its ID.
- Update an existing blog post, modify its content, or update its metadata.
- Delete a blog post and its associated data from the system.
- User authentication and authorization for protected endpoints.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) set up and running.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/islombek124/blogs-api.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd blogs-api
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the configurations as per your environment:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Make sure to set the correct MongoDB connection URL and any other required configurations in the `.env` file.

### Running the Application

Start the NodeJS server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:3000`, but you can configure the port in the `.env` file.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

- `GET /blogs`: Get all blog posts.
- `GET /blogs/:id`: Get a specific blog post by ID.
- `POST /blog`: Create a new blog post.
- `DELETE /delete-blog`: Delete a blog post.

For detailed information about the request and response formats, see the API documentation or the source code.

## Authentication

Certain API endpoints may require authentication. In the current setup, we are using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Users must obtain a valid token by sending a login request to the appropriate endpoint with valid credentials.

**Example Login Endpoint**: `POST /login`

Upon successful login, the API will provide a JWT token that needs to be included in the `Authorization` header for protected endpoints.

## Error Handling

The API follows standard HTTP status codes and provides error responses in JSON format. In case of an error, the response will contain relevant information about the error, such as error code, message, and possibly additional details.

## Testing

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

The tests cover different use cases and edge scenarios to ensure the correctness of the application.
